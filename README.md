# fidelityUtility
This is a webscraping tool for Fidelity

Everything is run locally, so you are safe inputting your login credentials into the program.

I've run these scripts 1000+ times and have never been locked out of my Fidelity account, but if you do end up getting locked out for some reason, it's not my fault.
